# Computational-Graphics
Interactive techniques and their applications using OpenGL: GLFW, along with 3-d image synthesis techniques.

What to know: 
- Any folder that starts with "asn" are projects.
- If there is only 1 folder showing that also begins with "asn", enter that folder.
- Once in the folder, there are many folders and files, that were mostly given for starting code.
- The pdf in each folder says which file was worked on or created.

Within this repository there are uses of the openGL: GLFW library for uses with lines and shapes within the User Interface.
There are also extended implementations for shading, lighting, and interaction with objects in a 2D & 3D environment.
